# Hi, I'm a Software DeveloperðŸ‘‹<b>

My language of choice is (and always has been) C#. I like to develop all sort of stuff, but nowadays I highly prioritize developing video games using the Unity Engine. My skill set is wide-ranging and includes several different technologies. Well, and on a good day I also know how to apply them properly, lol.
