# Hi, I'm a Software Developer from GermanyðŸ‘‹<b>

My language of choice is (and always has been) C#. I like to develop all sort of stuff, but nowadays I highly prioritize developing video games using the Unity Engine. My skill set is wide-ranging and includes several different technologies. Well, and on a good day I also know how to apply them properly, lol.

Currently I'm working on digital TCG, which is quite a difficult task to complete. It has been one of my main goals over the last years and it is my number one priority right now.
Here's a list of all the technologies I'm familiar with:

# IT
- .NET, C#, XAML
- C++
- JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js
- HTML, CSS
- Plain PHP, Symfony
- MySQL, PHPmyadmin

# MUSIC / MIXING / MASTERING
- Studio One
- Adobe Audition
- Cubase
- FL Studio
