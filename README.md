# Ayo, Fellas!<b>
Iâ€™m a software developer from Germany, working on collectible card game projects. For now, Iâ€™m mostly interested in C#, as it was my entry point into the world of programming, and I still love the language to this day.

Over the last couple of years, Iâ€™ve done many different and interesting things. Today, I have a wide range of skills and can program large and scalable systems on my own. I am always open to interesting collaboration opportunities
